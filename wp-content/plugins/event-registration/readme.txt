Event Registration is a WordPress plugin that allows you to manage events with an online and manual registration and payment process. 

== Description ==

This wordpress plugin is designed to run on a Wordpress website and provide registration events, classes, or parties. It is designed to be easy to navigate.
It allows you to capture the registering persons contact information and any additional infromation you request to a database and provides an association to an events database. 
It provides the ability to send the register to either a Paypal, Google Pay, Monster Pay,  or Authorize.net online payment site for online collection of event fees.
Additionally it allows support for checks and cash payments.  
Optional Captcha field on registration form.
Detailed payment management system to track and record event payments and support for PayPal payment notification.  
Reporting features provide a export list(s) of events, attendees, payments in excel or csv.  

If you like the plugin and find it useful, please donate.  
Your donations help me keep it going and improve it.  
You can find online information at http://wpeventregister.com/

Also if you could rate the plugin that would also be helpful.

== Upgrading ==

If you have used event registration in the past and desire to keep your data, version 6.0 will create new data tables and copy all your data upon activation.  
If you are unsatisfied with the upgrade, simply deactivate and delete the plugin.  You can then download the prior version and mannually upload to your system.  
All your old data will still be in tact as the upgrade copies and creates new tables, and leaves the existing ones for easy rollback.

Please note that because of conflicts with other plugins (people copying my work!), I have changed many of the shortcodes and functions, so you will need to update all your shortcodes on your pages.


* {EVENTREGIS}   Now -> {EVRREGIS}
* [Event_Registration_Calendar] Now -> {EVR_CALENDAR}
* {EVENTREGPAY}  Now -> [EVR_PAYMENT]
* [EVENT_REGIS_CATEGORY event_category_id="??"]  Now -> [EVR_CATEGORY event_category_id="????"] where ???? is your custom identfier - see category listing.
* [Event_Registration_Single event_id="??"] Now -> [EVR_SINGLE event_id="??"] where ?? is the ID number of the event.
* [EVENT_ATTENDEE_LIST event_id="??"]  Now -> 



If you are upgrading from a version prior to 6.0, I have made some major changes to the database and depending on your configuration, it may or may not upgrade the first attempt.  
I recommend activating and deactivating the new version several times. if you are having issues.
